## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (via SCSS)
  - custom properties
  - logical properties
  - flexbox
  - grid
- JavaScript (via TypeScript)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Microdata

### Useful resources

- [Detect JavaScript Support in CSS](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/detect-js-support-in-css/) - This helped me to serve CSS declarations which are applicable only when JavaScript is enabled just by using media queries and without any need for adding a class like `.js`.
